        <h2>Why Use a Title Company?</h2>
        Purchasing a home may be the biggest investment you make. As with every investment, you’ve done your research and know you’ve found the home for you. While the house and land may be tangible, visible assets, the actual title to own and possess the property is not. That’s where title companies come in.

        We research the title, examine all current and previous owners and interest holders, as well as any open mortgages, liens, judgments or taxes. We insure that your purchase is exactly what you’re expecting and facilitate the transfer of the title from seller to buyer.
